Concept solution for using Azure AD B2C in apps and microservices

I am working on a Universal Windows App that demonstrates how you can secure access to your asp.net web api's, and call them from an Universal Windows app through the new Azure Ad B2C Preview. Check out the code on GitHub. 

Early stage yet (so no documentation) but you can login through the app and get access to the api data. Next up is to create Sign up and edit profile fetures..

Future feature will be to add role based/group based access to api endpoints.
